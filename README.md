# Othello
This program allows you to play the board game Othello with your friends or against an AI! I completed this as my final project in my introductory computer science class during my freshman year of high school. To get started, when you run the program you will be asked two questions: whether or not you want to load a saved game, and if you want to play in one player mode, against the AI, or two player mode. When you are first loading up the program you will not (and cannot) load a saved game; see below for more. After answering these questions, you can get to playing!

After you start playing, you can save your progress at any point by pressing the "Save Game" button, and providing an appropriate name for your game. You'll then just have to reenter that name when playing again, and you begin playing right back where you were. If you are utilizing the `.jar` file, the metadata file for your saved game, with a file name the same as your given name, will be saved to the same directory as the `.jar` file. To be able to reload the game, note that the file must still be in the same directory as the `.jar` file.
